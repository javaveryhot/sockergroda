# Sockergroda
A free text sharing utility

The client-side is written in Java and the server-side is written in Python.

# Installation
To install, first download the appropriate file and then follow the instructions specific to your operating system and what file type you use.
Download a version [here](https://github.com/javaveryhot/sockergroda/releases) with your preferred file type (exe, jar, etc.).

You need to install [Java](https://www.java.com) to open jar files. If you don't have Java then use your operating system's executable instead.

## Windows
### Java (.jar)
#### File explorer:
* Right-click the downloaded file in file explorer, hover "Open with" and choose your Java program in the list.
#### Command-line:
* Open the `Command Prompt`, you can do `WIN + R` and type `cmd` in the input and press enter to open it.
* In the CLI, type `java -jar <path to the jar>` and press enter.

### Executable (.exe)
* Double-click the downloaded file in file explorer to execute it. You can also in many browsers just click the downloaded file once in the browser. Note: Windows may block the application, select "More information" and choose the option to run the program anyway.
