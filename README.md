## Windows
You need to install [Java](https://www.java.com) to open jar files. If you don't have Java then use the executable instead.

### Java (.jar)
#### File explorer:
* Download the correct `jar` file for the version you want to use (preferably the latest) from the `versions` directory.
* Right-click the downloaded file in file explorer, hover "Open with" and choose your Java program in the list.
#### Command-line:
* Download the file like above.
* Open the `Command Prompt`, you can do `WIN + R` and type `cmd` in the input and press enter.
* In the CLI, type `java -jar <path to the jar>` and press enter.

### Executable (.exe)
* Download the correct `exe` file for the version you want to use from the (preferably the latest) `versions` directory.
* Double-click the downloaded file in file explorer to execute it. You can also in many browsers just click the downloaded file once in the browser.
